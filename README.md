Dark7zip is project to experiment with dark mode for [7-Zip](https://github.com/ip7z/7zip) and its fork [7-Zip-zstd](#7-zip-zstd).  
It is mainly for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Some controls might, might not use dark/custom colors on older OS.

## Installation

Replace 7z original files (e.g. `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\`) with files from downloaded zip file.  

- `7zFM.exe` - file manager, "main exe"
- `7zG.exe` - mainly extraction, compression dialogs
- `7z.sfx`- optional, file needed for creating self-extracting archives
- `7zDark.ini` - optional, more information below

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ensure that you have downloaded the correct version. If the zip file name contains "zstd" (e.g. `7z-zstd-v24.09-v1.5.7-R1-dark-x64.zip`), it is intended for the zstd fork. If you are using the wrong version, a message box titled "7â€‘Zip ZS" will appear when attempting to extract the archive.

> [!NOTE]  
> Currently files are released only for x64 platform. You can get files for other platform from Github Actions for original 7-Zip, 7-Zip-zstd has only x64 platform. Ensure that you get correct version - [main](https://github.com/ozone10/7zip-Dark7zip/actions?query=branch%3Amain) for original 7-Zip, [7z-zstd](https://github.com/ozone10/7zip-Dark7zip/actions?query=branch%3A7z-zstd) for 7-Zip-zstd.

## Config

`7zDark.ini` is configuration file to allow mainly to set custom colors.
`7zDark.ini` should be in same folder as `7zFM.exe` and `7zG.exe`.

- [main]
  - mode - determine which sections color "key=value" pairs will be used and theming of title bar, buttons, scrollbars, and tooltips
      - 0 - use light mode 
      - 1 - use dark mode, default value
      - 2 - follow system settings

- [dark]
  - tone - set default colors for [dark.colors] sections, there are no tones for light mode
    - 0 - black, default value
    - 1 - red
    - 2 - green
    - 3 - blue
    - 4 - purple
    - 5 - cyan
    - 6 - olive
  - micaExtend - apply Mica material on all window/dialog, experimental, only for "dark" mode
    - 0 - apply Mica material only on title bar, default value
    - 1 - extend Mica material on all window/dialog

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `micaExtend=1` is only used with `[main]` `mode=1` and with `mica` with other valid values than `0`.
> `micaExtend=1` should also be used with HDR and ACM (Auto Color Management) off.
> Due to Windows bug using `micaExtend=1` can cause visual glitches, with HDR/ACM visual glitches are more severe (e.g. invisible controls).  
> It is also recommended when using with `mica=1` to turn off Settings -> Personalization > Colors -> "Show accent color on title bars and window borders" setting.

- [dark]/[light]
  - roundCorner - on Windows 11 specifies rounded corners preference
    - 0 - let the system decide when to round window corners, default value
    - 1 - never round window corners
    - 2 - round the corners, if appropriate
    - 3 - round the corners if appropriate, with a small radius
  - borderColor - on Windows 11 specifies the color of the window border, color is in RGB hex format - RRGGBB
    - FFFFFF - use default system color, special value, default value
  - mica - apply Mica material on title bar, requires Windows 11 22H2 build 22621
    - 0 - let OS automatically decide the use of Mica material, default value
    - 1 - do not use Mica material
    - 2 - apply Mica material
    - 3 - apply "acrylic" effect
    - 4 - apply Mica Alt material

Values for custom colors are in RGB hex format - RRGGBB.

- [dark.colors]/[light.colors]
  - background - for some controls (status bar, ...)
  - backgroundCtrl - mainly for controls with some input 
  - backgroundHot - for hot item
  - backgroundDlg - for dialog and some controls
  - text - for most text
  - textItem - for some controls
  - textDisabled - for disabled controls
  - edge - for border
  - edgeHot - for hot border
  - edgeDisabled - for disabled border

- [dark.colors.view]/[light.colors.view] - for listview and treeview
  - backgroundView
  - textView
  - gridlines - color for listview grid lines, when View -> Details is used and Tools -> Options... -> Settings tab -> Show grid lines is checked
  - backgroundHeader
  - backgroundHotHeader
  - textHeader
  - edgeHeader

All options are optional. You can define only "[section]" and "key=value" you want to be applied.  

> [!TIP]  
> Renaming section will disable all "key=value" pairs of that section and default values will be used.
